Cyber Security Internship/ Task-6 Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Understanding Password Strength and Testing

Creating a strong password is crucial to protect your digital accounts from unauthorized access. A strong password typically has:

* **Sufficient length** (usually 12 or more characters) to increase complexity.
* **A mix of character types**, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
* **Unpredictability**, avoiding common words, phrases, or easily guessable patterns.
* **Uniqueness** for each account, to reduce risks in case of breaches.

To ensure your passwords are secure, it’s important to test them against password strength tools. These tools analyze factors such as entropy, dictionary matches, and common patterns to estimate how difficult a password is to crack. By understanding what makes a password strong and validating it using these tools, you can improve your security and safeguard your information effectively.
